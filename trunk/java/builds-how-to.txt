JAVA BINARIES

To build the app, simply run "ant" from the command line.  You can then run the app with either the visual-programmer.sh
or visual-programmer.bat scripts.

WINDOWS EXECUTABLE
------------------
To create the .exe and .msi for Windows, run "ant create-web-distro" first.  That will create the .exe in
[VISUAL_PROGRAMMER_HOME]/code/web-distro/dist/windows.  You'll then need to run Advanced Installer
(www.advancedinstaller.com) on a Windows machine to create the .msi.  Do the following:

1) Copy the [VISUAL_PROGRAMMER_HOME]/code/web-distro/dist/windows directory to your Windows machine, or at least share
   it so the Windows machine can access it.

2) Run Advanced Installer

3) Open the CREATELabVisualProgrammer.aip project file.  Look things over, but you shouldn't need to change anything.
   If it all looks good, then just build the project. It will create the .msi in
   [VISUAL_PROGRAMMER_HOME]/code/web-distro/dist/windows/CREATELabVisualProgrammer-SetupFiles

4) Now open the CREATELabVisualProgrammerForFinch.aip project file.  As before, look it over, and then just build the
   project. It will create the .msi in
   [VISUAL_PROGRAMMER_HOME]/code/web-distro/dist/windows/CREATELabVisualProgrammerForFinch-SetupFiles

5) Copy the two .msi files created above to [VISUAL_PROGRAMMER_HOME]/code/web-distro/dist/ and then delete
   [VISUAL_PROGRAMMER_HOME]/code/web-distro/dist/windows
