JAVA BINARIES
-------------
To build the app, simply run "ant" from the command line.  You can then run the app with either the visual-programmer.sh
or visual-programmer.bat scripts.

STANDALONE APPS
---------------
Do the following to create the standalone apps for Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu:

1) From the Mac, run "ant clean create-web-distro". Note that you'll be prompted for the sudo password, because the
   build sets all the linux package directories and files to be owned by root (so that the Ubuntu package installer
   doesn't complain).
2) Switch to the Windows VM, and run "ant create-windows-msi".  Note that you will need to have the
   ADVANCED_INSTALLER_HOME environment variable defined. For me, it's set to:
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Caphyon\Advanced Installer 10.8"
3) Switch to the Ubuntu VM and run "ant create-linux-deb".
4) Switch back to the Mac and run "ant cleanup-linux-deb". You may be prompted again to enter the sudo password, because
   this task changes ownership of the linux package directories and files to be owned by the current user again, so that
   cleanup can continue.
