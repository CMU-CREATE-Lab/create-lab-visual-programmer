JAVA BINARIES
-------------
To build the app, simply run "ant" from the command line.  You can then run the app with either the visual-programmer.sh
or visual-programmer.bat scripts.

STANDALONE APPS
---------------
Do the following to create the standalone apps for Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu:

1) From the Mac, run "ant clean create-web-distro". Note that you'll be prompted for the sudo password, because the
   build sets all the linux package directories and files to be owned by root (so that the Ubuntu package installer
   doesn't complain).
2) Give the two .exe files to Tom to sign.
3) Once you get the two signed .exe files back from Tom, switch to the Windows VM, overwrite the old .exe files with the
   ones from Tom.  Then run "ant create-windows-msi".  Note that you will need to have the ADVANCED_INSTALLER_HOME
   environment variable defined. For me, it's set to: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Caphyon\Advanced Installer 10.8"
4) You should now have two .msi files.  Give those to Tom to sign.
5) Meanwhile, switch to the Ubuntu VM and run "ant create-linux-deb".
6) Switch back to the Mac and run "ant cleanup-linux-deb". You may be prompted again to enter the sudo password, because
   this task changes ownership of the linux package directories and files to be owned by the current user again, so that
   cleanup can continue.
7) Once you get the signed .msi files back from Tom, you can replace the old ones and then upload everything to the
   production site.
