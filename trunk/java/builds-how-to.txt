JAVA BINARIES
-------------
To build the app, simply run "ant" from the command line.  You can then run the app with either the visual-programmer.sh
or visual-programmer.bat scripts.

WINDOWS EXECUTABLES
-------------------
To create the .exe and .msi for Windows, run "ant create-web-distro" first.  Then switch to Windows and run the
"create-windows-msi" Ant task. Note that you will need to have the ADVANCED_INSTALLER_HOME environment variable defined.
For me, it's set to: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Caphyon\Advanced Installer 10.8"

MAC EXECUTABLES
---------------
The Mac executables are created with the "create-web-distro" Ant task.  No further steps are necessary.
