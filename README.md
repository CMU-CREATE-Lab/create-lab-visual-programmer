# Create-Lab-Visual-Programmer
The CREATE Lab Visual Programmer application.

This branch is devoted to bugfixes from Birdbrain Technologies LLC 

Bugs Fixed: 
  * Files starting with numbers are now okay. A letter is prepended onto the start automatically
  
In Progress: 
  * Playing audio better. Adding support for all types of wav and mp3s. 
      * Current State: All of the libraries have been updated to support playing audio files. Now changes just need to be made in the visual programmer itself to allow the importing and playing of these files using the new library methods.

To Fix:
  * TBD
