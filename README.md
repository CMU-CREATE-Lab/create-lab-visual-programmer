# Create-Lab-Visual-Programmer
The CREATE Lab Visual Programmer application.

This branch is devoted to bugfixes from Birdbrain Technologies LLC 

Bugs Fixed: 
  * #188 Files starting with numbers are now okay. A letter is prepended onto the start automatically
  * #196 Sequences can now be reordered with arrows that move blocks up or down. 
  
In Progress: 
  * #126 #128 Make audio player better. Adding support for all types of wav and mp3s. 
      * Current State: All of the libraries have been updated to support playing audio files. Now changes just need to be made in the visual programmer itself to allow the importing and playing of these files using the new library methods.

To Fix:
  * TBD
